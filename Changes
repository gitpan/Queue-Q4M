Changes
=======

0.00010 - 28 Jul 2008
  - Always check for minimum required verion of q4m at connect time.
    (the same check will fail if the connected database does not support q4m)

0.00010 - 18 Jul 2008
  - Be slightly be more paranoid about checking parameter type for
    fetch_*() methods.

0.00009 - 09 Jul 2008
  - Various tweaks for performance improvement. Probably 3 times as fast
    compared to 0.00002.
  - Recent versions of q4m no longer needed to specify the tables
    as database.table, so removed that logic.
  - Inline fetch_* methods, so that they can utilize the selectraw_* methods
  - Remove unnecessary caching.

0.00008 - 08 Jul 2008
  - Correctly auto-reconnect after a database disconnect.
    Fixed by Taro Funaki.

0.00007 - 08 Jul 2008
  - Add extended benchmarks under misc
  - No code change

0.00006 - 07 Jul 2008
  - Add clear() method

0.00005 - 02 Jul 2008
  - Fix a problem where conditional tables specifiers weren't handled
    correctly. Patched by Taro Funaki.

0.00004 - 24 Jun 2008
  - Fix a silly problem where passing arguments to next() wouldn't
    invalidate the previously executed statement
  - Fix a problem where $rv was being checked against success.
    The truth is, $rv is always a success - q4m returns 1 row regardless.

0.00003 - 23 Jun 2008
  - Fix a nasty bug in next()
  - Experimental: You can omit the table name if it's right after ->next call
    and you're still in the same scope

0.00002 - 23 Jun 2008
  - API incompatiblity! I tried to avoid it, but sorry, this version breaks
    compatiblity, so that you need to keep passing the target table name
    for each operation.
  - Moose!
  - Support multi table_cond queue_wait() calls

0.00001 - 09 Jan 2008
  - Initial release
