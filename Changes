Changes
=======

0.00003 - 23 Jun 2008
  - Fix a nasty bug in next()
  - Experimental: You can omit the table name if it's right after ->next call
    and you're still in the same scope

0.00002 - 23 Jun 2008
  - API incompatiblity! I tried to avoid it, but sorry, this version breaks
    compatiblity, so that you need to keep passing the target table name
    for each operation.
  - Moose!
  - Support multi table_cond queue_wait() calls

0.00001 - 09 Jan 2008
  - Initial release
