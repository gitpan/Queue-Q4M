Changes
=======

0.00006 - 07 Jul 2008
  - Add clear() method

0.00005 - 02 Jul 2008
  - Fix a problem where conditional tables specifiers weren't handled
    correctly. Patched by Taro Funaki.

0.00004 - 24 Jun 2008
  - Fix a silly problem where passing arguments to next() wouldn't
    invalidate the previously executed statement
  - Fix a problem where $rv was being checked against success.
    The truth is, $rv is always a success - q4m returns 1 row regardless.

0.00003 - 23 Jun 2008
  - Fix a nasty bug in next()
  - Experimental: You can omit the table name if it's right after ->next call
    and you're still in the same scope

0.00002 - 23 Jun 2008
  - API incompatiblity! I tried to avoid it, but sorry, this version breaks
    compatiblity, so that you need to keep passing the target table name
    for each operation.
  - Moose!
  - Support multi table_cond queue_wait() calls

0.00001 - 09 Jan 2008
  - Initial release
